# Specifications

## Overview

Specifications are the foundation of reliable AI systems. This section teaches you how to write clear, actionable specifications that reduce cognitive friction and help AI models understand exactly what you need.

Rather than vague requirements that force models to guess, you'll learn a complete framework: **MUST** constraints, **SHOULD** guidelines, **CONTEXT** for planning, **INTENT** for understanding why, and **VERIFICATION** protocols to confirm success.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Framework

The Specifications framework has four interconnected layers and Verification Protocols:

**[MUST Constraints](Specifications_2_MUST_Constraints.md)** - Hard boundaries and non-negotiable requirements  
**[SHOULD Guidelines](Specifications_3_SHOULD_Guidelines.md)** - Flexible preferences that adapt to context  
**[CONTEXT](Specifications_4_Providing_CONTEXT.md)** - Planning information about environment, users, and constraints  
**[INTENT](Specifications_5_Expressing_INTENT.md)** - The "why" behind your requirements and trade-offs  
**[VERIFICATION](Specifications_6_Verification_Protocols.md)** - How to confirm the model met your needs

## Why Specifications Matter

Vague requirements create cognitive friction. When models must guess what you mean, they:

- Waste context on wrong paths
- Make incorrect assumptions
- Produce unreliable results
- Require multiple iterations

Good specifications eliminate guessing. They give models the clarity needed to deliver what you actually want, the first time.

## Key Principle

**All five work together.** MUST defines boundaries. SHOULD provides flexibility. CONTEXT enables planning. INTENT reveals why. VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS confirm success.

Missing any layer increases cognitive friction and reduces reliability.
